A one sentence overview of your repository, meant for someone who is not familiar with the project:
This repository finds the best neighborhood in pittsburgh by looking at the neighborhood that is best for kids to live in, we found this by looking at the neighborhoods with the most parks, playgrounds, and water features. We looked at these because a kid outside that is hydrated is a happy kid and the happier the kids the better the nighborhood.
